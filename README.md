# ADKAVEH
This tool is designed for educational purposes.
The Adkaveh tool mentioned in the GitHub repository is a tool for conducting penetration tests and security evaluation in Active Directory environments. This tool focuses specifically on identifying and exploiting weaknesses in Active Directory infrastructure. The following is a further explanation of its features and performance:

 **Features and performance adkaveh:**

1. **Identify vulnerability:**
   - Adkaveh helps the intruders test to identify the vulnerabilities in the Active Directory environment. This includes the weaknesses of configuration, permits, and security settings.

2. **Collecting Information:**
   - This tool is capable of collecting various information about users, groups, and access in an Active Directory environment. This information can be used to evaluate security and identify weaknesses.

3. **Infiltration Techniques:**
   - Adkaveh includes techniques to infiltrate user accounts and obtain unauthorized access. This may include obtaining Credential (Certificates) or using social techniques to bypass security.

4. **Reporting and analyzing:**
   - This tool usually provides reporting and analytical capabilities to provide information security managers with understandable and structured results.

5. **Customize:**
   - There may be features to customize interactions and infiltration tests so that the user can adjust the tool to their specific needs and conditions.

6. **Help the security teams:**
   - This tool helps security teams and testers to identify and correct the weaknesses by simulating real -time attacks.

 **Important Tips:**
Ethical Use: Using tools such as adkaveh should be ethically and with the consent of the owner of the systems. The unauthorized infiltration test may be illegal.
- Education and awareness: Learning how to work with such tools can help improve cyber security and awareness of threats.


The Adkaveh tool, available in the GitHub repository, is designed to help the infiltrators test in the Active Directory security assessment. The tool supports several types of attacks and techniques aimed at identifying and exploiting weaknesses in Active Directory:

**Supported attacks on Adkaveh:**

1. **Kerberoasting:**
   - This attack allows the attacker to request Kerberos token for specific user accounts and then use them to obtain password hashs.

2. **As-reaproasting:**
   - It also allows the attacker to access AS-Req requests from specific user accounts and use them to obtain a password.

3. **Abuse of ACLS:**
   - The tool is capable of identifying and exploiting incorrect configurations in the Access Control List (ACLS) that can allow the attacker to access sensitive information.

4. **Credential Dumping:**
   - This attack deals with extracting users' certificates from different systems and can include the obtaining Credenials in the memory or local databases.

5. **Check permissions and points:**
   - The ability to analyze the permits and privileges of users and groups to determine if certain addresses are vulnerable.

6. **DCOM and WMI ABUSE:**
   - These attacks use Windows technologies to access user systems illegally.

**Summary:**
The Adkaveh tool supports several different types of attacks designed to test security and security evaluation. Attackers can identify weaknesses in Active Directory infrastructure and, if necessary, exploit them.
